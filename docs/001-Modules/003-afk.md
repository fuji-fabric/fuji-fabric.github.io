# Module: afk

## Overview
:::module
  This module provides:
  
  1. Afk Detection: When a player remains `idle` beyond a specified threshold, they are marked as being in `the AFK state`.
  
  2. Afk Event: Execute configured commands when a player `enters` or `leaves` the afk state.
  
  3. Afk Name Customization: Allows customization of the `display name` of AFK players.

  â—‰ How it works?
  
  
  
  For each player, define a `number` to track `the last action time`.
  
  Actions can be: `mine a block`, `movement`, `issue a command` ...
  
  When action received, update the number.
  
  Define a `job` using cron, to be triggered periodically.
  
  The job will check and compare 2 consecutive value of the `number`.
  
  If number is identical, then the player is considered as in `afk`.
