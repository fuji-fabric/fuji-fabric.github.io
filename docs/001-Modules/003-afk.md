# Module: afk

## Overview
:::module
  This module adds a `checker` to check if a player is in `Away From Keyboard` state.
  
  With the `afk` state:
  
  1. You can define `commands` to be executed when `enter this state` and `leave this state`.
  
  2. You can define the `display name` in this state.

  ◉ How it works?
  
  
  
  For each player, define a `number` to track `the last action time`.
  
  The `actions` can be: `mine a block`, `movement`, `issue a command`...
  
  When an `action` received, update the number.
  
  
  
  Define a `job` to compare 2 consecutive values of the `number`.
  
  If values are identical, then the player is considered as in `afk` state.
