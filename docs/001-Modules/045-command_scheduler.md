# Module: command_scheduler

## Overview
:::module
  This module allows executing commands on a `schedule`.
  
  
  
  Its typical use case is executing `broadcast commands` on a schedule.
  
  However, it can also be used to execute any specified commands.

  ◉ How it works?
  
  1. Define a `job` to execute `commands` on a schedule.
  
  1.a. The `schedule` is expressed using the `cron expression` language.
  
  1.b. You can specify multiple `cron expressions` for a `job`.
  
  1.c. A `job` is `triggered` if any of its `cron expressions` match.
  
  2. A `job` is automatically `triggered` according to its `cron expressions`.
  
  3. When a `job` is `triggered`, it will do:
  
  3.a. If the `enable` property is `false`, then do nothing.
  
  3.b. If the `remaining runs` property is `<= 0`, then do nothing.
  
  3.c. Otherwise, it decreases the `remaining runs` property by 1, and pick a random `command group` to execute.
  
  4. You can `trigger` a `job` using `/command-scheduler trigger <job>` manually.

  ◉ You can use `cron expression` generator, to specify when a `job` should be `triggered`.

  ◉ List the `next fire dates` for each defined `job`.
  
  Issue `/fuji inspect jobs` to see the `fire dates` of defined `jobs`.
