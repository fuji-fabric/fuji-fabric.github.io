  ◉ Make a GUI to display all available kits.
  
  You can integrate with the `command_menu` module.
  
  To create a `menu` to `display` available kits, making it easier to `claim` a `kit`.
  
  
  
  ◉ Attach the kit claim command to objects.
  
  You can integrate with `command_attachment` module.
  
  To attach the kit claim command to a `block`, `entity` or `item`.

  ◉ Create a kit.
  
  Issue: `/kit editor` to create a new `kit`.
  
  
  
  ◉ Give a kit to a player.
  
  Issue: `/kit give Alice <kit-name>` to give a `kit` to a player.
  
  
  
  ◉ Create a user-level command, for players to `claim a kit`.
  
  The `/kit give` command is a `admin-level` command, you should NOT allow players to use it directly.
  
  TIP: You need to use `command_bundle` module to create a new `user-level` command, for players to `claim a kit`.

:::colorbox-example

  ◉ Associate a cooldown to a kit.
  
  You can use `command_cooldown` module, to create a `named cooldown` for the `kit claim command`.
  
  
  
  To create a `named cooldown`
  
  Issue: `/command-cooldown create example-kit-cooldown 60000`
  
  
  
  To test the cooldown, and give the kit if the cooldown is satisfied.
  
  You need to configure the `try-use` section for the `named cooldown`, and use `/command-cooldown try-use` to use it.
