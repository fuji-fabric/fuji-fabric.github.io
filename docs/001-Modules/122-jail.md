# Module: jail

## Overview
:::module
  This module allows defining a `jail`.
  
  It can be used to `punish` players for misbehavior without `banning` them.

  ◉ How it works?
  
  1. Each `jail descriptor` is used to define a `jail` instance.
  
  1.a. You can `create` a descriptor using the `/jail create` command.
  
  1.b. You can `delete` a descriptor using the `/jail delete` command.
  
  1.c. You can `list` all created descriptors using the `/jail list` command.
  
  2. Each `jail` can hold `more than 1 player`.
  
  2.a. Each `jailed player` is recorded with a `jail record`.
  
  2.b. A `player` can only be put in one `jail` at a time.
  
  3. Each `jail` has a `position` property.
  
  3.a. It's `initialized` to your current position when you run the `/jail create` command.
  
  3.b. You can set a new position for it using `/jail set-position` command.
  
  3.c. You can teleport to the position using `/jail tp` command.
  
  4. You can `put` a `player` into a `jail`, or `un-put` it.
  
  4.a. To `put`, use `/jail put` command.
  
  4.b. To `un-put`, use `/jail un-put` command.
  
  4.c. To query the info, use `/jail where` command.
  
  
  
  ◉ The difference between `banned players` and `jailed players`.
  
  1. For a `banned players`: They can't `join` the server.
  
  2. For a `jailed players`: They can `join` the server.
  
  
  
   NOTE: A `jail` is only used to hold information.
  
   You need to write `punishment commands` in `onJailedEvent` and `onUnjailedEvent`.
  
   You can also write `patrol commands` to check and restrict the actions of the jailed players.

  ◉ The `placeholders` to the `position` of a `jail`.
  
  1. `%fuji:jail_dimension%`
  
  2. `%fuji:jail_x%`
  
  3. `%fuji:jail_y%`
  
  4. `%fuji:jail_z%`
  
  5. `%fuji:jail_yaw%`
  
  6. `%fuji:jail_pitch%`
  
  
  
  ◉ Restrict the `movement` of `jailed players` within a specified area.
  
  With the help of `position placeholders`, you can write `patrol commands` to restrict movements.
  
  You can define commands to restrict the movement of jailed players within a specified area.
  
  1. `/execute as %player:name% at @s unless dimension %fuji:jail_dimension% run execute in %fuji:jail_dimension% run tp @s %fuji:jail_x% %fuji:jail_y% %fuji:jail_z%`
  
  2. `/execute as %player:name% if entity @s[x=%fuji:jail_x%,y=%fuji:jail_y%,z=%fuji:jail_z%,distance=8..] run tp @s %fuji:jail_x% %fuji:jail_y% %fuji:jail_z%`
  
  
  
  NOTE: If you have enabled the `teleport_warmup` module, remember to assign the `warmup bypass` permission for the `jailed` user group.
  
  So that `jailed players` can be `instantly` teleported back to the `position of the jail`.
  
  1. `/lp group jailed permission set fuji.teleport_warmup.bypass`
  
  
  
  NOTE: To disable the `vanilla Minecraft command feedbacks`, you can issue:
  
  1. `/gamerule sendCommandFeedback false`

:::colorbox-tip

  ◉ Understand the `execution time` of a `command`.
  
  Some commands require the `target player` online to work.
  
  For example, the `/send-message %player:name% You are jailed.` didn't work if the target player is `off-line`.
  
  In this case, you can use the `command_meta.when_online` module, to submit and schedule a command.
  
  Issue: `/when-online %player:name% send-message %player:name% You are jailed.`
  
  
  
  ◉ Create a `luckperms group` for `jailed players`.
  
  You can create a `luckperms group` for `jailed players`.
  
  And assign the `positive permissions` and `negative permissions` to `jailed players`.
  
  Use the `permissions` to control the behaviours of `jailed players`.
  
  
  
  ◉ Restrict the actions of `jailed players`.
  
  You can integrate with the `anti_build` module.
  
  To assign `negative permissions` to `jailed user group`, to limit the actions of them.
  
  Issue:
  
  1. `/lp group jailed permission set fuji.anti_build.break_block.override.* false`
  
  2. `/lp group jailed permission set fuji.anti_build.place_block.override.* false`
  
  3. `/lp group jailed permission set fuji.anti_build.interact_item.override.* false`
  
  4. `/lp group jailed permission set fuji.anti_build.interact_entity.override.* false`
  
  5. `/lp group jailed permission set fuji.anti_build.interact_block.override.* false`
  
  NOTE: You need to enable the `wildcard permission` feature in `luckperms` mod config.

:::colorbox-tip

  ◉ Restrict `jailed players` to using only allowed commands.
  
  You can integrate with `command_permission` module.
  
  Issue:
  
  1. `/lp group jailed permission set fuji.permission.* false`
  
  Dis-allow to use `all commands`.
  
  
  
  2. `/lp group jailed permission set fuji.permission.back true`
  
  Allow to use the `/back` command.

:::colorbox-example

  ◉ Create a `jail` in your current position.
  
  Issue: `/jail create <jail-id>`
  
  
  
  ◉ Set the position of a jail to your current position.
  
  Issue: `/jail set-position <jail-id>`
  
  
  
  ◉ Teleport to the position of a jail.
  
  Issue: `/jail tp <jail-id>`
  
  
  
  ◉ List all created jails.
  
  Issue: `/jail list`
  
  
  
  ◉ Put a player into a jail.
  
  Issue:
  
  1. `/jail put Steve <jail-id> Steal items.`
  
  2. `/jail put Steve <jail-id> --duration 1s2m3h4d5w6M7y Steal items.`
  
  
  
  ◉ Un-put a player from the jail.
  
  Issue: `/jail unput Steve`
  
  
  
  ◉ Query which jail a player is in.
  
  Issue: `/jail where Steve`
