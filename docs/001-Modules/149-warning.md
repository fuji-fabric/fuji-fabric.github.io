# Module: warning

## Overview
:::module
  This module provides the `information management` for `staffs`.
  
  A shared `warning GUI` to `track` the behaviours of players, between `staffs`.
  
  You can `create` a `warning` for a `player`.
  
  All `staffs` can `view` the `warnings` of a `player`.
  
  
  
  You can use `warnings` to `track` the behaviours of a `player`.

## Color Boxes

  ◉ Integrate with advanced `ban` tools.
  
  You can integrate the `warning` module with `temp_ban` module.
  
  However, you may want some advanced ban tools.
  
  See: https://github.com/Patbox/BanHammer
