  Issue: `/command-attachment attach-block-one ~ ~ ~ --interactType STEP_ON <command>`
  
  
  
  ◉ Create a `knock-back stick` that kick the entities around you.

  ◉ Use a lower `angle` for `fast horizontal movement`.
  
  1. `/launch facing @s 15 1`
  
  2. `/launch facing @s 15 3.9`
  
  The `power` is clamped in `[-3.9, +3.9]`
  
  
  
  ◉ Use a median `angle` for `balanced horizontal and vertical movement`.
  
  1. `/launch facing @s 30 3.9`
  
  2. `/launch facing @s 45 3.9`
  
  
  
  ◉ Use a higher `angle` for a `rocket launcher` effect.
  
  Issue: `/launch facing @s 60 3.9`
  
  TIP: Remember to bring your `elytra`.
  
  
  
  ◉ Use a `vertical angle` for a `trampoline` effect.
  
  Issue: `/launch facing @s 90 1`
  
  
  
  ◉ Use a `positive power` for a `push` effect.
  
  Issue: `/launch facing @s 0 1`
  
  
  
  ◉ Use a `negative power` for a `pull` effect.
  
  Issue: `/launch facing @s 0 -1`
  
  
  
  ◉ Use another entity's perspective as the direction, to `kick` the target entity.
  
  Issue: `/launch at @s @e[type=!minecraft:player,distance=..8] 30 1`
