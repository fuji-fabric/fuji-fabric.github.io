# Module: command_cooldown

## Overview
:::module
  This module allows defining a `cooldown` after command execution.

  ◉ There are 2 types of `cooldown`.
  
  1. `Unnamed Cooldown`
  
  You can use it to define a `cooldown duration` for a specified command. (It is `tested` and managed automatically)
  
  A `unnamed cooldown` will not be `persisted` on the server shutdown.
  
  Its typical use is to define a `cooling duration` for a specified command.
  
  And a `unnamed cooldown` will be `tested` automatically when a player executes a command.
  
  For example: define a `3 seconds` cooling duration for `/back` command.
  
  To define a `unnamed cooldown`, you need to modify the config file, and issue `/fuji reload` command to apply it.
  
  NOTE: The `console` and `players with level permission 4` can `bypass` the `unnamed cooldown`.
  
  
  
  2. `Named Cooldown`
  
  You have to use commands to create a `named cooldown`, and use commands to `test` it.
  
  A `named cooldown` will be `persisted` on the server shutdown.
  
  Its typical use is to define a `named cooldown`, and `associate` it with `arbitrary command instance`.
  
  For example, you have to use `/command-cooldown create` to `create` a `named cooldown`.
  
  Then, you have to use `/command-cooldown test` to `test` a `named cooldown` manually.
  
  You have to specify the `failure case commands` and `success case commands` when `test` a `named cooldown`.
  
  If the `conditions` defined by the `named cooldown` is satisfied, then it is a `success case`, else it is a `failure case`.
  
  For `success case`, we will execute `the success case command`.
  
  For `failure case`, we will execute `the failure case command`.
  
  
  
  NOTE: If you only want to define a simple `cooling duration` for a specified command, just use `unnamed cooldown`.

:::colorbox-note

  ◉ The `command cooldown` will NOT be applied if...
  
  1. The command source is `the console`.
  
  2. The command source is `admin` (level permission >= 4)


:::

:::colorbox-example

  ◉ Create a `named cooldown`. (With 3 seconds `cooldown duration`.)
  
  Issue: `/command-cooldown create kitfood 3000`
  
  
  
  ◉ Test a `named cooldown` with `arbitrary command instance`.
  
  Issue: `/command-cooldown test kitfood Alice say Used successfully once`.
  
  This command will `test` the specified `named cooldown`:
  
  1. If the result is `the success case`, then it will execute `/say Used successfully once`.
  
  2. If the result is `the failure case`, then it will do nothing.
  
  
  
  Issue: `/command-cooldown test kitfood Alice --onFailed "say false" say true`
  
  This command will `test` the specified `named cooldown`:
  
  1. If the result is `the success case`, then it will execute `/say true`.
  
  2. If the result is `the failure case`, then it will execute `/say false`.
  
  
  
  TIP: You can insert `%fuji:command_cooldown_left_time kitfood%` placeholder to display the remaining duration.
  
  TIP: To specify `more than 1 command` in the `the success command` or `the failure command` place, you can use `chain` module.
  
  
  
  ◉ Test a `named cooldown` with `pre-defined command instance`.
  
  You can `pre-define` the `success case commands` and `failure case commands` in the config file.
  
  And use `/command-cooldown try-use kitfood Alice` to `test` it.
  
  This method is much more brief.
  
  
  
  ◉ Reset a `named cooldown` for a player.
  
  Issue: `/command-cooldown reset kitfood Alice`
  
  
  
  ◉ Create a `named cooldown`. (With 15 seconds `cooldown duration`, and `limit of number of use` is 3)
  
  Issue: `/command-cooldown create kitfood 15000 --maxUses 3`
  
  
  
  ◉ Create a global `named cooldown`.
  
  By default, a `named cooldown` applies `per-player`.
  
  A `global` named cooldown applies `per-server`.
  
  Issue: `/command-cooldown create kitfood 3000 --global true`


:::

:::colorbox-example

  ◉ Make a `non-persistent named cooldown`.
  
  By default, a `named cooldown` will be `persisted` on the `storage`.
  
  However, you can create a `non-persist named cooldown`.
  
  Issue: `/command-cooldown create kitfood 999999999999 --persistent false`
  
  This cooldown says that, it can be used only once after each server re-start.

## Jobs
:::job
- Job Name: `ConfigurationHandlerWriteStorageJob`
- Document:   This `job` is used to `write data` from `memory` into `storage`.
  
  
  
  NOTE: If you modify the `file` in `disk`, then you need to issue `/fuji reload` as soon as possible.
  
  NOTE: The `disk` will be `overridden` when `fire` this job.
