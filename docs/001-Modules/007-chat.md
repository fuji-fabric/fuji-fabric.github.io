  ◉ The compatibility issue with other `chat-related` mods.
  
  There is not a standard API to interact with the vanilla Minecraft's chat system.
  
  It makes the compatibility issue between `chat-related mods` harder to resolve.
  
  
  
  I try my best to write the code in the most compatible way.
  
  If any of the chat module doesn't work, feel free to open an issue.
