  ◉ How it works?
  
  Inside the vanilla Minecraft, there is a teleport function for teleportation.
  
  We listen on this teleport function, and wrap it with a warmup cooldown.
  
  
  
  ◉ How can I specify different cooldown time for different commands?
  
  You need to use `command_warmup` module.
  
  The `command_cooldown` module will simply treats `all` the teleportation request the same.
  
  That's because we only know there is a teleport request.
  
  But we didn't even know who creates this teleport request.
  
  So we have to treat `all` teleportation the same.
  
  
  
  ◉ What's the purpose of teleport warmup.
  
  The main purpose is to prevent the `abuse` of `teleport commands` in vanilla Minecraft.
  
  Like, use teleport commands to escape death.
  
  NOTE: The `admin players` can bypass the teleport warmup.

  ◉ The `teleport warmup` will NOT be applied if...
  
  1. The target dimension is not defined in the `effective dimensions` list.
  
  2. The target player's `age <= 3`
  
  3. The target player is a `fake player`.
  
  4. The target player has the `warmup bypass permission`.
