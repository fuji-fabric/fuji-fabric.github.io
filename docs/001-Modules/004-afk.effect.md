# Module: afk.effect

## Overview
:::module
  This module applies `effects` for a player in `afk` state.
  
  Supported effects are:
  
  1. `Invulnerable`: a player in afk state is immune to all `damage`.
  
  2. `Targetable`: a player in afk state cannot be selected as a `target` by hostile entities.
  
  3. `Moveable`: the position of a player in afk state can not be `moved` by `external cause`. (Piston, Gravity...)
