# Module: command_bundle

## Overview
:::module
  This module allows `creating` a new command (Called `template command` or `bundle command`):
  
  - `User-Defined Arguments`: the new command can accept user-defined arguments.
  
  - `Command Body`: the body of a new command can consist of a list of existing commands.
  
  - `Placeholders`: the body can support placeholder parsing.
  
  
  
  It can be used as a generic `command template` system.

  ◉ The features of this module:
  
  1. Provide a user-friendly DSL, to create `a new custom command` easily.
  
  2. Support the inter-operation with `user-defined variable`, `placeholders` and `vanilla target selectors`.
  
  3. Support complex `argument types`: `required argument`, `literal argument` and even `optional argument with a specified default value`.
  
  4. A powerful `type-system`, to use the built-in `argument types`.
  
  5. Register and un-register `custom commands` on the fly, without a server re-start.

  ◉ The `purpose` of this module
  
  This module allows you to `define` a `new command`.
  
  To `define` a new command, you need to specify the following things:
  
  1. The `pattern` of this new command: If the pattern is `claim-kit example`, then the new command is `/claim-kit example`.
  
  2. The `bundle` of this new command: It is the `body` of this new command. It is `a list of commands` to be executed.
  
  
  
  To define a new `bundle command`, you need to specify the `pattern` and the `bundle` for it.
  
  The `pattern` describes: what does your `new command` look like?
  
  The `bundle` describes: what `commands` should we execute when your `new command` is executed?

  ◉ The syntax of the `pattern`.
  
  The `pattern` is composed by a list of `command node`.
  
  For example, the `pattern` instance `first second third` describes a command `/first second third`.
  
  It is composed by 3 `command node`, they are all `literal arguments`.
  
  
  
  In the syntax of `pattern`, there are 3 types of `arguments`:
  
  1. `Literal Argument`: You can write it down directly. For example `first`, `second`, `third`, and `claim-kit` are all literal arguments.
  
  2. `Required Argument`: It's syntax is `<arg-type arg-name>`. For example, `<int age>` means a `required argument` whose `argument type is int` and `argument name is age`.
  
  3. `Optional Argument`: It's syntax is `[arg-type arg-name default-value]`. It is similar to `required argument`, but you can provide a `default value` if this argument is not specified by the `command source`.
  
  
  
  You can `reference` the value of `Required Argument` or `Optional Argument` in the `bundle` component.
  
  For example, you can write down `$age` to refer to a `variable` named `age` defined in the `pattern` component.
  
  
  
  ◉ What is the `type system` used by the syntax of `pattern`?
  
  Fuji will register an `argument type adapter` for a specific `argument type`.
  
  You can issue `/fuji inspect argument-types` to list all registered `adapters`.
  
  You can use any `argument type` listed in that GUI.

:::colorbox-note

  ◉ The syntax of the `bundle`.
  
  Actually, the `bundle` is just a `list of commands`.
  
  You can write `Minecraft commands` directly in the `bundle` list.
  
  
  
  When a `bundle command` is executed, we will execute the `list of commands` defined by `bundle` from up to down.
  
  Commands are executed `as console`.
  
  You can use `/run as player` or `/run as fake-op` to switch the command execution context, if it is needed.

:::colorbox-tip

  ◉ Generate powerful commands using a generator.
  
  You can use command generator to get powerful commands:
  
  https://www.gamergeeks.net/apps/minecraft/particle-command-generator


:::

:::colorbox-example

  ◉ Use a `bundle command` to combine many commands into one command.
  
  In this example, we want to register a new command `/composite-heal`.
  
  To `decorate` an existed command `/heal`.
  
  The decorations are:
  
  1. We will `say` before the execution of `/heal` command.
  
  2. We will spawn a `heart particle` before the execution of `/heal` command.
  
  3. We will `say` after the execution of `/heal` command.
  
  
  
  To define this `bundle command` as shown below.
  
  Pattern: `composite-heal`
  
  Bundle:
  
  1. `say before heal %player:name%`
  
  2. `run as fake-op %player:name% particle minecraft:heart ~ ~2 ~`
  
  3. `run as player %player:name% heal`
  
  4. `say after heal %player:name%`


:::

:::colorbox-example

  ◉ Use a `bundle command` to transform the form of an existed command.
  
  In this example, we want to register a new command `/warn`.
  
  As a `shortcut command` to a specific command instance.
  
  
  
  Pattern: `warn <player player-arg> <greedy greedy-arg>`
  
  Bundle:
  
  1. `run as player %player:name% send-message $player-arg <red>You are warned: $greedy-arg`


:::

:::colorbox-example

  ◉ Use a `bundle command` to wrap a specific command instance.
  
  In this example, if you want to allow players to use `/give @s minecraft:apple`.
  
  You only want to allow the players to get free `apples`.
  
  And you didn't want to allow players to use `/give` command arbitrarily.
  
  
  
  Then, you can define a `bundle command` like `/free-apple` to `wrap` a specific instance of `/give` command.
  
  Pattern: `free-apple`
  
  Bundle:
  
  1. `run as fake-op %player:name% give @s minecraft:apple`
  
  
  
  ◉ Define a `bundle command` to wrap a specific `/kit give` command instance.
  
  Pattern: `kitfood`
  
  Bundle:
  
  1. `run as fake-op %player:name% kit give @s kit-food`


:::

:::colorbox-example

  ◉ See more advanced examples.
  
  The default config file contains a set of `advanced examples`.
  
  You can see there are many pre-defined `bundle commands`.
  
  Their name starts with `/my-command`.
  
  
  
  Besides, there are also a set of pre-defined `bundle commands` for convenience.
  
  For example: `/gmc`, `/gms`, `/day`, `/sun`...


:::

:::colorbox-example

  ◉ Transform the form of a command.
  
  - `/blocknbt` -> `/data get block`
  
  - `/entitynbt` -> `/data get entity`
  
  - `/gm`, `/gms` and `/gmc` -> `/gamemode`
  
  - `/findbiome` -> `/locate biome`
  
  - `/flyspeed` -> `/attribute Alice minecraft:generic.flying_speed`
  
  - `/walkspeed` -> `/attribute Alice minecraft:movement_speed`
  
  - `/maxhealth` -> `/attribute Alice minecraft:generic.max_health`
  
  - `/groundclean` -> `/kill @e[type=...]`
  
  - `/spawnmob` -> `/summon`
  
  - `/shoot` -> `/summon` with motion
  
  - `/smite` and `/thunder` -> `/summon minecraft:lighting_bolt`


:::

:::colorbox-example

  ◉ Define a `/tpw` command to teleport players to a specified dimension.
  
  Pattern: `tpw resource-world`
  
  Bundle:
  
  1. `run as fake-op %player:name% tppos --centerX 0 --centerZ 0 --maxRange 128 --dimension fuji:overworld`
